<center><h1>FairSplit is a Horizons Hackathon project.</h2><center><br><br>

<p>Based off tragic real-life experiences with a five-page Google Doc for the Harvard Class of 2018 arranging Uber rides, FairSplit was born. Every time spring break or thanksgiving break or back-to-school or any major break arrives, posts pop up in the Facebook group: Who wants to split an Uber or UberPool? This solves that problem.</p>

<p>The struggle is real:</p><br>

		<p>FairSplit was created in a 24-hour period by a crestfallen team of one, potentially a team of half because of sleep deprivation.</p><br>
	  <div class="row" style="padding: 0px 150px 10px">
	      	<div class="col-md-6"><p>The calendar aspect of FairSplit is based off code provided by <a href="http://fullcalendar.io/">FullCalendar</a>, a life-saving JQuery plugin that was discovered long after attempting two other painful calendar implementations. Form implementation and the adding of events was done with handlebars.</p></div>
	  		<div class="col-md-6"><p>The messaging aspect of FairSplit was based off similar projects in former Horizons projects, also accomplished through handlebars. Thank you to the Horizons instructors and TA's for the free Monster, as well as the assistance.</p></div>

<center><h2>Improvements to Consider:</h2><br></center>
<p><ul>
<li>When clicking "send message," have that username appear as the "to" address, rather than having to retype it. This is critical and shameful that it has not been implemented.</li>
<li>Implement better security features, as well as a verification service through which a college email address is required.</li>
<li>Fix the "Add Event" form so that it's a modal rather than a whole new page.</li>
<li>Clean up the code, particularly the in-line styles that gets messy.</li>
<li>Add capabilities of choosing your college campus.</li>
<li>Allow more details to be added to each departure time, such as exact location (the quad is pretty far from the river, after all...) and have options to filter by these general locations (yard, river, quad)</li>
<li>Set up capability of deleting event once the car limit is reached.</li>
<li>Linke messages to email with Sendgrid, perhaps, so that they come to your email instead.</li>
</ul></p>
