  "description": "This is a project I worked on individually during the Horizons School of Technology 24-hour Hackathon. Based off tragic real-life experiences with a five-page Google Doc for the Harvard Class of 2018 arranging Uber rides, FairSplit was born. Every time spring break or Thanksgiving break or back-to-school or any major break arrives, posts pop up in the Facebook group: Who wants to split an Uber or UberPool? This solves that problem -- it's simple, quick, organized, and gets the job done in a matter of seconds.",
